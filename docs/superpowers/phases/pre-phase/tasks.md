# Pre-phase task ledger

Status ledger for issue-routed work while no phase is active (coordination.md → Supervision-loop contract → *No active phase*). Same rules as a phase `tasks.md`: builders append a status line per transition; fable reads it on the supervision loop. Stall threshold: 45 minutes.

Status vocabulary: `claimed → branch → tests green → PR open → review clean → ready-to-merge` (plus `blocked: <reason>` / `released`).

Format: one line per transition, newest last:
`- <UTC timestamp> <handle> #<issue> <status> [note]`
